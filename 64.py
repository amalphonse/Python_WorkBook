The following code prints Hello, checks if 2>1 and then
breaks the loop because 2 is actually greater than 1. Therefore Hi 
is not printed out. Please replace break with something else 
so that Hello and Hi are printed out repeatedly.

while True:
    print("Hello")
    if 2>1:
        break
    print("Hi")
